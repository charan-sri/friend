      I wish this bond would continue till the last.Every moment with you guys make the happiness of my life.
    No bond is with happiness all the way,even complications arise in the journey,we break,we fight,we stand still again as together.
  This is what called a perfect bond.Happiness comes from a struggle of hardtimes where we were taken care of a person,
that's you-My friend infact MY WORLD.💖</i></ol></h2></td>
